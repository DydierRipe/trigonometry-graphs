# trigonometry-graphs


This project is a little project of some weeks, some things like the graphs position and some parameters still on debuging and another variables needs to be generated aacording to the parameters specified by the programmer, others builders is needed too. The graphics are unexactly with their position, but if you want to have a "exactly" graph you can use the 0째 + 10째 point (when you use trigonometry the functions have diferent results until 359째 because the graphichs and results reboot from 360 and its multiples (F(10) = F(370) = F(730))) in the 2째th paramater of each trigonometric function.

Graphics.h is modified with some functions, and MathAdv is a auxiliar function for get the cotangent, the secant and the cosecant.

Is not recomended modify the struct called console.

Thank you a lot nwn.
